These are my notes so far:

Make a new directory:
    mkdir <new name>
    cd <same name>

Initialize a new repository
    git init

Check up on your new repository
    git status

Pick an IDE
    I chose vim, don't choose vim
    You might like Sublime Text 2, or PyCharm, or PyDev, or Eclipse, or emacs

Open a file, notes.txt, in your new directory (in that repository)

Notes: hey how about WHY

Add a file to the repository
    git add <that file>

Create a new commit!
    git commit -m 'this is my commit message'

Whoops, deleted notes.txt
    git checkout notes.txt

Create a new feature branch
   git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

What branch am I in?
    git branch -a
