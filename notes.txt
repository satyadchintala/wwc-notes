These are my notes so far:

Make a new directory:
    mkdir <new name>
    cd <same name>

Initialize a new repository
    git init

Check up on your new repository
    git status

Pick an IDE
    I chose vim, don't choose vim
    You might like Sublime Text 2, or PyCharm, or PyDev, or Eclipse, or emacs

Open a file, notes.txt, in your new directory (in that repository)

Notes: hey how about WHY

Add a file to the repository
    git add <that file>

Create a new commit!
    git commit -m 'this is my commit message'

Whoops, deleted notes.txt
    git checkout notes.txt

Create a new feature branch
   git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

What branch am I in?
    git branch -a

Okay, back to master
    git checkout master

I liked those changes though
    git merge <that-feature-branch>


Workflow so far

git init
repeat {
    git checkout -b <feature-branch>
    repeat {
        make changes to <files>
        git add <files>
        git commit
    }
    git checkout master
    maybe {
        git merge <feature-branch>
    }
}
